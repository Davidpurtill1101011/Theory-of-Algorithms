## Post Correspondence
Inside the folder called Assignment you will find a notebook that talks about the Post Correspondence Problem and the Bound Correspondence.

## Technologies 
The technologies that are used for this are [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) where the blend of both are used to work on the assigment given.

### Undecidable Problem in Computability Theory
Is a decision problem that any random yes or no question where it has a infinite set of inputs. This is a usual way to define the decision problem that correspond as the set of inputs where the problem returns as true. The inputs can be anything from a number to a string from a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language). And then by using [Godel numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering) to do some encoding for the strings to be turned into natural numbers. This then lets a phrase to be passed as a set of natural numbers, which makes it easier to define.
