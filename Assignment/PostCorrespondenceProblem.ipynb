    "The Post Correspondence Problem is a very popular way of working out a [undecidable problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem) that was introduced by [Emil Leon Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Leon_Post) in 1946.\n",
    "### Definition of Problem\n",
    "The input of the problem has two finite lists of strings which is showen below in the table. Each string looks similar to what is in each cell of the table. The idea of Post Correspondence is to check and see if both sets of strings are the same, they dont need to be layed out the same as each other but need to contain the same amount of letters as each pther and can make up the same concatinated strings if need be. With the code that is written below both list 1 and list 2 fairly similar strings that can end up being the same as shown when passed into the method, And both return true which is tested below.\n",

    "### Explination of Post Correspondence Problem\n",
    "If you take a set that contains all the possible outcomes of sets and if they correspond they must return true and then if they dont it must return false, When each set of strings is set out they should be able to combine L1 and have it look a way and then do the same with L2 and have that to look the exact same way as L1 as shown above. Each row in the combined set should be able to be used as many times as you want. And the best to find the answer is using a [finite state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). A good way to try and start is having the first symbol on the top match the first symbol on the bottom.\n",
